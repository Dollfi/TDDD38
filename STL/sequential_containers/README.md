# A test project to test different sequential containers

Three sequential containers (vector, deque and list) is tested with different data sets to try and find out where to use the different containers.

Results (on my mashine) can be found in the folder ```img```

To use the test system, start by compiling the source (with optimizations, ```-O2``` or release mode). The program runs with 10 000 values as default, but takes command-line arguments to change this.   

The program does output to both STDOUT and STDERR to make it simple to separate the output. The data used by ```parse_results.py``` is printed to STDOUT. 

The output in the directory ```output_dir``` was generated by commands according to:

```for num in 10000 20000 50000; do a.out $num > output_dir/result_$num; done```

To generate images, the program ```parse_results.py``` is used. It requires python3 with the matplotlib library. If you are unable to install libraries at your system, a virtualenv can be created to run the script:
```
$ virtualenv -p python3 Virt
$ . ./Virt/bin/activate
$ pip install matplotlib
$ python3 parse_results.py
$ deactivate
```
